/*
    ‚ùå Why Insertion Sort is not commonly used in production:

    1. Poor Time Complexity for large arrays
       - Worst-case: O(n¬≤) when array is in reverse order
       - Average-case: O(n¬≤)

    2. Too slow for large datasets
       - Not suitable for real-time or large-scale production systems

    3. Performs unnecessary comparisons for unsorted data

    ‚úÖ When Insertion Sort is Useful:

    1. Small datasets (especially < 10 elements)
    2. Partially sorted data
       - Best-case: O(n) when array is already sorted

    3. Easy to implement
       - Simple logic, great for understanding how sorting works

    4. Stable sort
       - Maintains the relative order of equal elements

    5. In-place algorithm
       - No need for extra memory (space complexity O(1))

    üìö Summary:
       Insertion Sort is better than Bubble and Selection sort in many real-world small array cases.
       It's used internally by more complex algorithms like TimSort for small partitions.
       However, for larger data, prefer Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or in-built sorting functions.
