/*
    ‚ùå Why Bubble Sort Is Not Used in Production

    1. Very Poor Time Complexity
       - Worst-case: O(n^2)
       - Average-case: O(n^2)
       - Makes too many comparisons and swaps even for medium-sized arrays.

    2. Too Slow for Large Data
       - Extremely inefficient for large datasets.
       - Cannot scale for real-time systems or production environments.

    3. Repeated Passes Even on Sorted Arrays
       - Without optimization, it blindly runs every pass.
       - Even with a swap-check flag, it still performs many unnecessary operations.

    4. Not Adaptive or Efficient
       - Doesn‚Äôt adjust behavior based on how sorted the data already is.
       - Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort adapt better.

    5. Not Used in Real Libraries
       - Java, Python, and other languages use TimSort, QuickSort, etc.
       - These algorithms are highly optimized for real-world performance.

    ‚úÖ When is Bubble Sort Okay?
       - Teaching algorithm logic (simple to understand)
       - Small arrays (e.g., <10 elements)
       - Visualization tools for educational purposes

    üß† Summary:
       Bubble Sort is a great tool to learn how sorting works,
       but it‚Äôs not suitable for use in production code.
